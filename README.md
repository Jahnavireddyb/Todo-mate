## What Todo-mate Does

Keep track of everything from quick reminders to project-level tasks:

- Save to-do items into default folders (**Home**, **Today**, **Week**) or create your own custom project folders.
- View full to-do details, edit them, delete them, or mark them as completed.
- Assign one of **three priority levels** to each task.
- See how many tasks are left:
  - Remaining unchecked items are shown next to each project name.
  - Total unchecked items are displayed in the **Home** title.
- Take quick notes in a **Pinterest-style notes section** – dynamically add, remove, or edit notes.
- Fully responsive layout that works across desktop and mobile.
- All data is saved to **localStorage**, so your tasks persist across refreshes.

## 🧠 Future Ideas

Planned / nice-to-have features:

- Sort tasks by **date** or **priority**.
- Add user **logins** and allow **shared projects/notes** between users.
- Optional dark mode toggle.
- Search/filter bar to quickly find tasks.
